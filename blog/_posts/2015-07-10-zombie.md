MSM is no longer dead! But hang on, it may not be alive yet. In [@zachlatta](https://github.com/zachlatta)'s words:

It's my hope that MSM can now better match the community's needs as they exceed my own.

To support this community approach MSM now lives under it's own organisation at [github.com/msmhq/msm](https://github.com/msmhq/msm).
