* Start, stop and restart your server
* Create [WorldEdit snapshot][we-snapshot] compatible backups of your worlds
* Backup the entire server folder for complete protection
* Load world's into RAM for faster access (reduces lag)

## Upcomming features

* **Provisioning:** Create, move, delete and manage multiple servers from one script.
* **Restore:** Roll-back to an old world or whole server backup automatically.
* **QuickBackup:** If you store your backups non-locally (maybe on a NAS), QuickBackup optionally creates a backup locally for speed, and then moves it after your players are building again!
