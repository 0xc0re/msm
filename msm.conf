# Minecraft Server Manager Configuration File
# ===========================================
#
# 

# User
# ----

# The user which Minecraft Server Manager commands will be executed as.
# Also used by default for starting servers who do not specify an individual
#Â server user.
USERNAME="minecraft"


# Directory Locations
# -------------------

# These values are very important. They define where MSM stores various files

# Where new servers are stored
SERVER_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/servers"

# Where runnable jar files for use by servers are stored
JAR_STORAGE_PATH="/opt/msm/jars"


# Where RAM enambled worlds are stored
# This needs to be a path located inside the mounted ramdisk for your system
# under Ubuntu this would be "/dev/shm", so "/dev/shm/msm" would be a good
# location. If left blank RAM disk will not be used.
RAMDISK_STORAGE_PATH="/dev/shm/msm"


# Quick IMPORTANT note:
# The following three paths are used to store backups of your servers which
# MSM creates periodically. Backups are usefull if a world becomes unlayable
# and needs to be restored to an earlier point in time. Or maybe a new plugin
# for a server corrupts some files. In these cases you can restore to a
# backup from these directories.
#
# If you want protection for disk failure also, be sure to spcify paths to a 
#Â separate disk. This can be achieved by mounting an external hard drive, or
# a NAS and put the following paths in there.


# Where "WorldEdit snapshot" compatible world backups are stored.
WORLD_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/worlds"

# Where archived logs are stored, when a servers logs are "rolled":
LOG_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/logs"

#Â Where complete server backups are stored:
BACKUP_ARCHIVE_PATH="/opt/msm/archives/backups"



# Server Defaults
# ---------------

# These values are the default values used when a server does not override
#Â them in its individual config file.
# They are also the default values used when a new server is created, without
# specifying any arguments.

# {RAM} - Gets replaced with the amount of RAM specified for the server

#
# Hard coding values here (not using {MEMORY} and {JAR} tags) will result in
#Â all servers using the values.
